Hi! My name is Marat Subkhankulov and I love getting lost in the programming flow.

I'm currently working at HPE Nimble Storage as a full-stack developer on our predictive
analytics portal - [Infosight](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/storage/infosight.html).
In my spare time I contribute to [Trust - Ethereum Wallet](https://trustwalletapp.com/) Android app.

This isn't the first blog I started but I hope to stay here for a while and post
on technical topics - Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot, Android, coding puzzles, daily dev struggles.

Though most of my work is closed source, some is publicly available:
- [Trust Android](https://github.com/TrustWallet/trust-wallet-android-source)
- [Distributed bitcoin miner](https://github.com/maratsubkhankulov/miner-server)
- [Lines solitaire (game)](https://github.com/maratsubkhankulov/lines)

Past blogs I've kept:
- [Know Yo' Algorithms: algorithms and data structures in Python](https://knowyouralgorithms.wordpress.com/)
- [Magical tramp: game programming experiments](https://magicaltramp.wordpress.com/)
- [Ringing ears of Marat: personal blog](https://ringingearsofmarat.wordpress.com/)
