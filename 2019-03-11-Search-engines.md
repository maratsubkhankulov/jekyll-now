## Papers on search

Since I joined the Uber search team, I thought it would be prudent to study up on the field. Here is a sample of papers I've been reading:
1. [Lucene](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2795/d9d165607b5ad6d8b9718373b82e55f41606.pdf)
2. [Twitter's Earlybird](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/publications/Busch_etal_ICDE2012.pdf)
